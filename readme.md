- did it have a good design?
- could the design be done better?
- was there even a design at all?
- how do you know if software was well designed?
    - think of how easy it was to make changes to your code
- did a small code change produce a ripple-effect for changes elsewhere in the code?
- was your code hard to reuse?
- was your software difficult to maintain after a release?
